		as the unwalkable fraction of the sphere stays small, since this is
		plain rejection sampling, not an exact walkable-area parametrization.
		@param radius the sphere's own radius (must match whatever `isWalkable` was built against).
		@param isWalkable whether a candidate world position is a valid place to grow a tuft — a biome's own notion of "not inside a wall/column/etc.".
		@param count how many tufts to scatter; defaults to `DEFAULT_TUFT_COUNT`.
		@param random source of randomness in [0, 1); defaults to Math.random.
		@param heightScale multiplies every tuft's own height and width — for a biome where the grass has to read from across the sphere rather than just underfoot (see `biomes.wind.WindBiome`), since a blade at that distance otherwise covers well under a pixel. Width scales too, at a lower power: taller blades that stayed as thin would disappear edge-on at exactly the range they need to be legible at.
		@return the scattered tufts.
